            <details><summary> Background | <span>Economic Downfall | Separation South Sudan</span></summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Well before the current Sudanese events, South Sudan officially split of from North Sudan in 2011. Consequently, <u>the issue of governance</u> has been a hot topic in both independent countries. It was this friction that drove North Sudanese protestors to peacefully challenge their military regime in 2018. A strong motivator was a steady increase of average cost of living and an according <u>deterioration of North Sudan's economy</u>. The loss of steady cashflow from South Sudan's oil reserve is the most probable cause.

            <details><summary><span>Al-Bashir's</span> reign </summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Al-Bashir had become president in 1989 by means of coup-d'état (= overthrowing government by means of combat). He stayed in power through election fraud, <u>crimes against humanity and a national culture of terror and rape.</u> In international diplomacy Sudan and al-Bashir are indeed accused of such terror.
              <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When South Sudan separated, al-Bashir continued his reign. But, in December 2018, the citizens' discontent with al-Bashir's reign had ignited. They took to the streets in protest.

            <details><summary><span>Al-Bashir's</span> downfall</summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The North Sudanese government's responded to the protests of 2018 with a shut-down of telecommunications and other infrastructure. What followed were a large number of <u>arrests, killings, cases of torture, and forced confessions</u> on the government's behalf. The brutalities carried on until April 11 2019, when rebelious military performed a coup d'état and detained al-Bashir.

            <details><summary><span>After the</span> Military Coup</span></summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;North Sudan's terror had not halted with the military coup. Protesters continued to demonstrate as they wanted nothing to do with another military government. In opposition to the violent power struggles that had marked their country for decades, the protesters united under the name of <u>peaceful protest</u> as the South-Africans successfully did under N. Mandela. 
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Despite the peacefulness of the citizens' movement, the new military regime feared its existence as it calls for a civilian government. The protest continued from April to June while the reigning regime was pressured from additional, international sides. Triggered by this tension and fear, the government carried out shot into a group of peaceful protesters on June 3 2019, <u>killing over 100 people</u>. Hospitals were simultaneously targeted by armed forces. 
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The day after this <u>Karthoum massacre</u>, North Sudan carried out nationwide civil obediece / a strike. </p>

            <details><summary>Current State</summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;From the massacre in June onwards, the 'trasnitional military government' is diplomatically forced to come to terms with its people; the government realizes civil obedience and pressure from other African countries and - allegedly - countries as Russia, China and USA have <u>the power to undermine its existence</u>.
              <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As of now, these negotations continue. On July 5, parties agreed on a transitional period lasting 3 years, with a military-led government ruling the period's first half and a civilian-led one ruling the second half.
