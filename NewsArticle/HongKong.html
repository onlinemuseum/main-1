          <br>Caused by bill allowing extradition of Hong Kong lawbreakers
          <br>
          For protesters it's the <i>pivot point</i> for years of Chinese encroachment on Hong Kong's governance and judicial system: It ignited <i>more than 10.000</i> protesters

            <details><summary><span>Direct Reason:</span> Extradition bill</summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<u>The protest's cause:</u> Hong Kong authorities sought to implement a bill allowing extradition of lawbreakers in Hong Kong. The protestors find issue with the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, who has fondly supported the bill. Protesters claim she was selected, rather than elected by a dubiously small election committee manipulated by China.

            <details><summary><span>Indirect Reason:</span> Incremental Tension</summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; In 2008, Iran had denied having a <u>nuclear weapons program</u>. It explained its occupation with Urianium with the development of nuclear powerplants and the according technology. Closer to 2019, suspicions turned out to be legitimate. 
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To the USA, it has become increasingly clear that Iran is looking for stronger regional control and - most importantly - <u>increased control over the oil trade.</u> Becuase of the suspicion the USA 'aired' drone reconnaissance programs. 
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Chief Executive Carrie Lam seems to prove her own allegiance to China's mainland as she shows no attempt to listen to a loud voice of Hong Kong's citizens. Without issuing value labels, our point could indicate the local state of affairs. While Chinese media and authorities indicate Lam is democratically elected by a committee, the true degree of her representativeness is strongly questionable.

            <p>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Several organizations call for protection of Hong Kong civilians. <u>Amnesty International claims</u> China uses <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/hong-kong-police-violence-verified/">sheer force against a relatively peaceful protest.</a> 
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The Hong Kong Journalists Association accused police of <u>whittingly targeting journalists</u>. They claim the following:<br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;~ Use of strong flashlights to hinder people filming. <br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;~ 26 Journalists were harmed.<br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;~ Journalists were police-searched without particular reason
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<u>Pressured water, rubber bullets, tear gass, batons, bodily violence, insults </u> have reportedly been used by Hong Kong police to deter protestors.
