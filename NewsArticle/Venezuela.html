            <details><summary><span>Terror steadily rose from</span> 2010 - Today</summary>
            <p>Under Chávez, Venezuela increasingly focused on oil export. <u>Domestic agriculture</u> declined and <u>reliance on import</u> grew. High corruption, sanctions and low oil prices ignited the current crisis. Initially people <u>heralded Chávism</u>and its communism. </p></details>

            <details><summary>Rich of oil | <span>USA's enemy</span></summary>
            <p>Venezuela reportedly has the <u>highest oil resource</u> in the world (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves">Link</a>). The evidently corrupt elite favoured a national focus on oil export, which helps generate more money through corruption. An apparent <u>lack of care</u> about proper managament made problems steadily scale over the years. Venezuela has traditionally antagonized the <u>USA</u> and, when problems arose,  claimed the world leader caused the country's problems. Hugo Chávez notoriously calls this the USA's <u>'economic war'</u> against his people. Regardless, they have denied <u>foreign aid</u>, intensifying the existing problems.</p></details>

            <details><summary>Communistic <span>Country | Example</span> Mao Zedong</summary>
            <p>Glorying communisim, Chávez' implemented a program after the example of <u>Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward</u>, which caused terror, famine and high casualties with the hope to become a superpower. Like Mao, Chávez ruled his country in a <u>totalitarian way</u>. He censored and manipulated official reports. This control reached onto the economy: where legitimate traders were heavily managed. As a result, civilians resorted to the <u>Black Market</u> and establishments went bankrupt and imports decreased further. </p></details>
