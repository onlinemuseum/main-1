            <details><summary><span>USA alleges Iran of </span> sabotaging of oil freighers <span> in May and June 2019.</span></summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In May 2019, USA reports indicated naval transport could be at risk in the Persian Gulf and specifically warned Iran <u>not to strike</u>. The reports turned out to be correct as a handful of cargo ships <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2019_Gulf_of_Oman_incident">were damaged in US-controlled waters</a> at the U. A. Emirates.
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;US Officials pointed to Iran as the culprit and immediately deployed more troops and materials to the region. A few weeks after (June), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2019_Gulf_of_Oman_incident">two other oil tankers were attacked</a></p></details>

            <details><summary><span>Nuclear Program </span></summary>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; In 2008, Iran had denied having a <u>nuclear weapons program</u>. It explained its occupation with Urianium with the development of nuclear powerplants and the according technology. Closer to 2019, suspicions turned out to be legitimate. 
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To the USA, it has become increasingly clear that Iran is looking for stronger regional control and - most importantly - <u>increased control over the oil trade.</u> Becuase of the suspicion the USA 'aired' drone reconnaissance programs. 
            <br><br></p>
            </details>
            
            <details><summary><span>Drone reconnaissance </span> | "Obliteration like you've never seen before"</summary>
            <p>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The tension it caused with Iraq reached a peak in 2011, when an Iranian cyberwarfare department <u>took control of a USA drone</u> and stole it for close technological inspection. <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Another peak was reached in June 2019, when a US drone was shot by a land-to-air missile. The US army allegedly sought immediate retaliation, but president Trump had halted any engagements 10 minutes prior to mission launch; he sought to avoid war with Iran. In stead, he strongly increased sanctions, deployed B-52 bombers in the region and informed Iran that conflict would mean <u>"Obliteration like you've never seen before"</u>.<br><br></p>
            </details>


            <details><summary><span>Russia's meddling</span></summary>
            <p>
              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;During the Syria crisis, it became apparent that <u>Russia seeks control over the Middle East</u>. The trend was reiterated earlier this year, when the country supplied Turkey with a highly capable missile system despite US' strong resistance. It is unclear whether Russia seeks to provide the same S-400 missile system to Iran, but both rumours and motive are present. 
              <br><br>
              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Russia's interest in Iran stems from the country's positon as <u>bastion against full US control over the Middle East</u>. As we noticed in the Gulf War, Iran is a large country with much potential. The tensions between USA and Iran have high stakes and should be followed carefully.</p>
